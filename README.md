## Requirements:

This project is created with official create-react-app package of React. It is spesificly designed as a take-home interview question. This project is designed to evaluate your knowladge lifecycle of React components. Current source code includes Highcharts package to make you familiarise to our work environment. We added all Highcharts related snippets to the code so you will not need to know or learn any Highcharts spesific coding practice.

It includes two React components:
* App
* component/MyChart

Feel free to refactor any part of he code you find incorrect in terms of coding best practices. We especially missused some coding conventions. You can get full grade without making expected refactorings. Consider it as a bonus part.

The directory includes a Git repositoy. Make the best use of git and keep your latest code on master branch. It would be good if you commit your changes frequently and please do not hasitate to make mistakes on the development process. We will only review your commit log text to understand your ability to use version control systems. Multiple branches will be ignored.

Please read all comment lines to understand requirements. If you have any question you can send your questions to: serkan.altuntas@tga.gov.tr
